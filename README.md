# DiamondGuru
The DiamondGuru Programming Language. (Conceptual)

### DiamondGuru's compiler is written in python, which compiles DiamondGuru source code to C
### Then use gcc to compile compiled C source to binary

### How to run -
```command
$ git clone https://github.com/DuskyElf/DiamondGuru.git
$ cd src
$ python3 DGuru.py compile <DiamondGuru_script_file_path>
```

### Things that are currently done -
- Expression parsing
- Strict type checking at compile time
- Support for dynamic variables at compile time
- Pre - Compiled
- Error free
